# Personal Research on META AI's Masked Autoencoder Model 

### Personal Note
Inspired from META's Segment Anything (SAM) Paper I decided to learn more about the structure of the masked autoencoder (mae) that is used in SAM.

### Discovery and Implementation 
I primarily modified the way masking is performed my the masked autoencoder model by lessening the randomness of the model and implementing more predominance
